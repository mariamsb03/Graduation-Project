The project “Detection of Distracted Drivers” focuses on recognizing distracted 
drivers’ behavior through employing machine learning models. Our first step was 
scraping a table that shows the distribution of distracted behavior across adult road 
users in Lebanon, according to baseline demographics. After that, this data was 
visualized using Tableau for further analysis. 
Leveraging an existing dataset from Kaggle that contains pictures of distracted and 
non-distracted drivers, three classification machine learning models were developed 
and compared through several matrices. Random Forest, Decision Tree and K-Nearest 
Neighbor, these models were trained to detect if the driver is distracted and what is the 
distraction behavior. 
The results of these models serve as a valuable tool in determining who is at fault when 
accidents happen. Also, the models can be utilized by the government to identify 
drivers who are breaking the law and to enforce penalties accordingly.
